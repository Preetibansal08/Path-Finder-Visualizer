## 🚀 Features

- Interactive grid-based visualization
- Wall creation via click-and-drag
- Random start and end point generator
- Animated path tracing
- Shortest distance displayed after algorithm completes

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Supported

- ✅ Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- ✅ A* (A-Star) Algorithm
- ✅ Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- ✅ Depth-First Search (DFS)

---

## 🎯 Randomized Start/End & Distance Display

- Automatically selects random **start** and **end** points
- Pathfinding algorithm runs between them
- Visually highlights the path
- Displays the **total path distance** in steps

This makes testing different grid conditions fast and effective.
